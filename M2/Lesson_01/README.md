# Module 2 Lesson 1
1. After watching the *Snowsight Development Environment* video lesson on Coursera, make sure to run the contents of [M2L1V3.sql](https://github.com/dataprofessor/fast-prototyping-of-genai-apps-with-streamlit/blob/main/M2/Lesson_01/M2L1V3.sql) in a SQL worksheet in your Snowflake Snowsight workspace. This would allow you to create the `avalanche_db` database and `avalanche_schema` schema, which you'll need for running the next lesson.
2. Download [M2L1V4.ipynb](https://github.com/dataprofessor/fast-prototyping-of-genai-apps-with-streamlit/blob/main/M2/Lesson_01/M2L1V4.ipynb) locally and import it into Snowsight as a Snowflake Notebook.
   - During the notebook setup process, specify the `avalanche_db` database and `avalanche_schema` schema as the location where the notebook will reside under the **Notebook location** field of the **Create notebook** modal.
   - Leaving everything else at default, click on the **Create** button.
